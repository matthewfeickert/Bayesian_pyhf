# Experiments

Experiments are a collection of ideas, trials, and GitHub Gists.
They are not meant to be long standing working examples, refer to the `examples/` directory for that, but instead a way of building up intuition and experience that is documented.

## Note on Jupytext

`.py` files in this directory are automatically paired with a `.ipynb` file. To generate a `.ipynb` file, in Jupyter Lab right click on the file and then select "Open with" -> "Notebook". Alternatively, from the command line you can generate the notebook file with

```
jupytext --to notebook <file name of .py file>
```
